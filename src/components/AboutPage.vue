          <p>Hi, I'm Layla. I build cool things for the web and beyond.</p>

            My favorite part of being a full-stack developer is the rapid pace
            of technological change<span>&#8212;</span>
            meaning there are always new learning opportunities. My goal is to
            create meaningful software to help others increase productivity at
            work, home, or anywhere. I have the most fun building data-driven
            projects using databases, Laravel, Vue, and APIs; however, I
            do enjoy making responsive front-end web applications.

            I am also a mom, registered dietitian nutritionist, adjunct
            instructor, and avid community volunteer. You can find me at many
            local tech meetups in OKC!
